# Sugya Archaeology Methodology

## Core Insight

When tracing Torah sources, think like a ben Torah in the beis medrash:
- Where would you send a talmid to learn this sugya?
- What are the FOUNDATIONAL sources that define the issue?
- Who are the key Rishonim/Acharonim who shaped the discussion?

## The Citation Chain

```
Topic Query
    ↓
Primary Gemara Sugya (where is the issue discussed?)
    ↓
Rishonim on that sugya (Rashi, Tosfos, Ramban, Rashba, Ritva)
    ↓
Rambam / Tur / Shulchan Aruch (how is it codified?)
    ↓
Acharonim (deeper analysis, machlokesim, modern applications)
```

## Finding the Ikkar

Don't just find ANY source that mentions a keyword. Find the IKKAR - the foundational discussion.

### Example: Chuppas Niddah
- **Ikkar sugya**: Kesubos 4a-b (not Niddah, not Kiddushin!)
- **Key question**: Does chuppah work when she's a niddah?
- **Trace UP**: Mishna Kesubos 1:1 → Gemara 4a → Rashi/Tosfos there
- **Trace ACROSS**: Rambam Ishus 10 → Even HaEzer 61 → Beis Shmuel, Chelkas Mechokek

### Example: Bitul Chametz
- **Ikkar sugya**: Pesachim 4b-7a
- **Key question**: Is bitul deOraisa or deRabbanan? What formula?
- **Trace UP**: Mishna Pesachim 1:1-2 → Gemara → Rishonim
- **Trace ACROSS**: Rambam Chametz uMatzah 2-3 → Orach Chaim 434 → Mishnah Berurah

## Citation Patterns in Hebrew Texts

When reading Acharonim, look for these markers:
- `ע"ש` / `עיין` = "see there" → they're pointing to a source
- `כמ"ש` / `כמש"כ` = "as written by" → citing someone
- `הקשה` / `והקשה` = "asks/challenges" → machlokes
- `ד"ה` = "s.v." (dibbur hamaschil) → pinpointing location in Rashi/Tosfos
- `בסוגיין` = "in our sugya" → the primary discussion
- `ועיי"ש` / `ועי' שם` = "and see there" → cross-reference

## Masechta Recognition

When Claude sees a topic, immediately think: "Which masechta's territory is this?"

| Topic Area | Primary Masechta | Secondary |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Marriage/Kesubah | Kesubos, Kiddushin | Gittin, Yevamos |
| Shabbos/Yom Tov | Shabbos, Beitzah | Eruvin |
| Kashrus | Chulin, Zevachim | Bechoros |
| Nedarim/Shevuos | Nedarim, Shevuos | Nazir |
| Money matters | Bava Kamma/Metzia/Basra | Sanhedrin |
| Mikvaos/Taharah | Niddah, Mikvaos | Keilim |

## What Makes a Source "Good"?

A source is valuable if:
1. **It directly discusses the specific aspect** you're asking about (not just mentions a keyword)
2. **It's cited by multiple authorities** (convergence = importance)
3. **It illuminates a machlokes** or key sevara
4. **It's from the right "layer"** for the query intent:
   - Lomdus → go deep into Gemara + analytical Acharonim
   - Psak → focus on Shulchan Aruch + practical poskim
   - Makor → find the earliest source
