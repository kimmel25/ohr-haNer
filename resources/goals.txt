Purpose & context
Doyv is a kollel student who learns Torah full-time and is developing "Marei Mekomos," a Torah source-finding application that serves the Modern Orthodox community. The tool helps users find relevant Jewish texts on any topic, from bar mitzvah speeches to rabbinic shiurim preparation. Doyv has programming experience from college (Java, C#, databases, React) and wants to monetize his Claude Pro subscription through a software product that generates income without requiring client management, given his unpredictable schedule with kollel and family responsibilities.
The application combines Claude AI with Sefaria's API using a "sugya archaeology" approach - searching through later commentaries (acharonim) to discover which earlier sources they cite most frequently, revealing foundational texts. Doyv demonstrates deep Torah knowledge and learning methodology, understanding the importance of finding the "ikkar" (foundational sources) rather than just keyword matches. He's paying API costs out of pocket while developing the product for eventual sale.
Current state
Doyv has built a complete proof-of-concept using Python FastAPI backend and React frontend. The system validates Claude's source suggestions against Sefaria's database to prevent hallucinations - a key advantage over existing tools like ChatGPT that fabricate sources. He's implemented a two-tier caching system with aggressive caching for acharon texts and cautious caching for final results to manage API costs.
The application successfully connects to both Claude and Sefaria APIs and returns topic summaries, but Doyv has encountered issues with search accuracy, particularly with ambiguous queries returning sources from unintended areas of Jewish law. He's actively debugging and refining the system based on detailed testing and log analysis.
Key learnings & principles
Doyv prioritizes accuracy over speed, preferring Claude to "urge on the side of caution" rather than make confident assumptions about unfamiliar topics. He's learned that existing competitors like GoTorah are limited to weekly Torah portions, while his tool's ability to handle any topic provides a significant competitive advantage.
He's discovered that a conversational approach works better than rigid categorization - the system should ask clarifying questions like a natural study partner (chavrusa) rather than assume user intent. The two-tier caching strategy balances cost management with result freshness, recognizing that source texts never change while search results may need updates.
Approach & patterns
Doyv takes an iterative development approach, testing multiple versions and providing detailed feedback on search results. He removes features that don't add value (like beginner/intermediate/advanced levels) in favor of query-driven depth. His methodology emphasizes building conversational refinement systems that ask natural questions when queries are ambiguous, reflecting his understanding of traditional Torah learning partnerships.
He focuses on providing sources rather than generated content, encouraging users to learn the material themselves. His debugging process involves systematic log analysis and API connectivity testing to isolate issues between Claude's suggestions and Sefaria integration.
Tools & resources

Development stack: Python FastAPI backend, React frontend
APIs: Claude AI API, Sefaria's free API
Key references: Specific commentaries including Pnei Yehoshua, Ketzos HaChoshen, Kesef Mishneh
Target platform: Web application serving the Modern Orthodox community


Future Goals:

--- Shiur setting ---
- Maarei Mekomos for a given topic/ shiur setting
- Different levels of that

--- Shayla setting ---
- Simple question and answer setting
- "Where can i find info about tfillah in the rashba" or "how many times does the word yissachar appear?"


--- Notes ---
- smooth out the responses, maybe bold important lines
- lines finish in middle of a word
- an email feature would be really cool! at least a query but maybe even dialougue
