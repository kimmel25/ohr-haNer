# How to Think About Finding Sources

This isn't a rigid methodology. Torah learning is creative and flexible.
Here are DIFFERENT WAYS to approach a query - use your seichel (judgment).

## Different Approaches (No Particular Order - All Equally Valid)

### Go Straight to the Sugya
When you know where the primary discussion is, just go there:
- Identify the main Gemara
- Look at Rashi/Tosfos
- See how it's codified (Rambam/SA)
- Maybe check Acharonim for deeper analysis

Example: "bitul chametz" - Primary sugya is Pesachim 6b-7a. Start there.

### Follow the Machlokes Thread
When there's a famous dispute:
- Find where the disagreement starts
- Trace how different authorities take sides
- See how practical halacha develops

Example: "chuppas niddah" - Machlokes starts in Kesubos 4a, trace through Rishonim → SA → Acharonim.

### Start from Chumash/Mishna
When the topic is foundational, begin with earliest sources:
- Start with pasuk or Mishna
- See how Gemara develops it
- Follow forward chronologically

Example: "tumas meis" - Starts in Chumash (Bamidbar 19), then Mishna, then Gemara.

### Go to the Expert
When certain authorities are THE specialists:
- Identify who knows this topic cold
- Go directly to their analysis
- Use them as entry point

Example: Mikvaos → Chazon Ish. Choshen Mishpat → Ketzos. Don't search everywhere, go to who knows.

### Work Backward from Later Sources
Sometimes you DON'T know where the sugya is, so start with later authorities who discuss it:
- Find an Acharon who analyzes the topic
- See which earlier sources THEY cite
- Follow those citations backward

Example: "kim lei bgavei" - If you don't know where to start, Ketzos discusses it and cites the relevant Gemaras. Follow his trail.

### Just Explore
Sometimes you need to wander:
- Start somewhere reasonable
- Follow interesting connections
- Let one source lead to another
- Synthesize what you find

Example: Complex safek sfeika question - might need to check Chullin, Sotah, general principles, all over.

## The Real Key: Convergence

Forget about which method you used. What matters is CONVERGENCE:
- If 3+ sources cite the same Gemara → that's important
- If multiple Rishonim reference the same sevara → pay attention  
- If everyone discusses a certain Tosafot → that's crucial

Convergence reveals what's actually important, regardless of how you found it.

## Query Intent Matters

**Lomdus** ("How does this work?"): 
Go deep. Ketzos, Pnei Yehoshua, Reb Akiva Eiger. Trace the sevara.

**Psak** ("What should I do?"):
Focus on SA + practical poskim. Mishnah Berurah, Aruch HaShulchan. Skip deep lomdus unless it affects psak.

**Makor** ("Where does it say this?"):
Find EARLIEST source. Chumash → Mishna → Gemara. Later stuff is less relevant.

## Don't Follow Formulas

Torah is **endless** and **creative**. These are tools, not rules.

The best approach might be:
- Something completely different from what's listed here
- A combination of multiple approaches
- Following your gut about what makes sense
- Asking the user what they actually want to understand

**There is no "right way" to find sources. Think like a chavrusa helping someone learn.**

Torah isn't a database with optimal queries. It's a living conversation going back thousands of years. Be part of that conversation.
