# Learning Examples - Different Ways of Thinking

These are real examples from my learning showing how to approach different topics FLEXIBLY.
No two questions are the same. No formula works for everything.

## Example 1: Chuppas Niddah (Following a Machlokes)

**Question:** Can chuppah be koneh when the kallah is a niddah?

**My approach:** This is a famous machlokes, so I traced the dispute.

**What I found:**
- Gemara Kesubos 4a: The primary sugya discussing the issue
- Rashi vs Tosfos disagree on the sevara
- Rambam Ishus 10:11 paskens one way
- Shulchan Aruch Even HaEzer 61 follows Rambam
- Beis Shmuel has a different take
- Pnei Yehoshua analyzes the logic deeply

**Key lesson:** When there's a machlokes, START with where the disagreement begins (Gemara), then trace forward through how different rishonim/acharonim take sides. Don't just search "niddah" everywhere.

## Example 2: Bitul Chametz (Straight to the Sugya)

**Question:** Is nullifying chametz deoraisa or derabbanan?

**My approach:** I know this is discussed in Pesachim, so I went straight there.

**What I found:**
- Mishna Pesachim 1:1-2: Mentions the bitul but doesn't explain the source
- Gemara 6b-7a: The ikkar discussion of whether it's min haTorah
- Rashi explains the basic pshat
- Tosfos asks questions from other sugyos
- Rambam Chametz uMatzah 2-3 codifies the halacha
- Orach Chaim 434: The practical application
- Tzelach and Reb Akiva Eiger go deep into the lomdus

**Key lesson:** When you know where the sugya is, GO THERE FIRST. Don't start with Acharonim. Get the Gemara straight, then see how later authorities understand it.

## Example 3: Kim Lei Bgavei (Working Backward When Lost)

**Question:** What's the principle of kim lei bgavei?

**My approach:** I didn't know where this is discussed, so I started with someone who I figured would know.

**What I found:**
- Ketzos HaChoshen (Choshen Mishpat 38) has a major piece on this
- He cites Kesubos 32a-33a as the primary Gemara  
- Also references Bava Kamma
- Following his citations, I found the Gemara sources and earlier Rishonim

**Key lesson:** When you're LOST and don't know where to start, find someone who's an expert on that type of topic. They'll point you to the right places. This isn't "the method" - it's just what made sense when I had no better entry point.

## Example 4: Safek Sotah (Following My Chavrusa's Question)

**Question:** My chavrusa asked about safek safek by sotah - is she mutar to her husband?

**My approach:** This was complex - multiple layers of safek. I needed to understand the concept first.

**What I found:**
- Started with Sotah masechta to understand the basic din
- Found a sugya about safek sotah in Sotah 28a (approximately)
- Realized this involves safek sfeika principles, so checked that in Chullin too
- Rambam in Hilchos Sotah discusses the various scenarios
- The Kesef Mishneh explains Rambam's reasoning
- This led me to understand it's about chazaka vs rov

**Key lesson:** Sometimes you need to EXPLORE. I didn't have a preset path. I followed the question where it led - from Sotah, to safek sfeika in Chullin, to chazaka principles. Torah learning is ASSOCIATIVE, not linear.

## Example 5: Taanas Besulim (Multiple Angles)

**Question:** The din of taanas besulim in Kesubos.

**My approach:** This topic is discussed from MULTIPLE angles, so I looked at each one:

1. **The basic din:** Mishna Kesubos 1:4, Gemara 9a-10a
2. **The financial aspect:** How much does he pay? Gemara 10b
3. **The witness aspect:** Edus isha vs edus ir, different Gemara entirely
4. **Rov vs chazaka:** Gets into principles from other masechtos
5. **The psak:** Rambam Naarah Besulah, Even HaEzer 67-68

Each angle required a different approach. Sometimes the sugya, sometimes the codification, sometimes a principle from elsewhere.

**Key lesson:** Complex topics don't fit one method. You need to attack from multiple directions and synthesize.

## What Makes a Source "Good"?

From all this learning, here's what I've noticed makes a source valuable:

1. **It directly addresses the specific question** - Not just mentions a keyword
2. **It's cited by others** - Convergence indicates importance
3. **It clarifies a machlokes or ambiguity** - Helps understand the issue
4. **It provides the underlying sevara** - Not just "this is the halacha" but WHY

## The Meta-Lesson

Each question needed a DIFFERENT approach:
- Chuppas niddah → Follow the machlokes
- Bitul chametz → Straight to the sugya
- Kim lei bgavei → Work backward from expert
- Safek sotah → Explore and synthesize
- Taanas besulim → Multiple angles

There's no formula. There's no "the way."

**Think like a chavrusa:**
- What would actually help someone understand this?
- Where does it make sense to start?
- What connections matter?
- What's the real question behind the question?

That's Torah learning - **creative, flexible, endless.**

Don't try to fit everything into one methodology. Let each question teach you how it wants to be approached.
